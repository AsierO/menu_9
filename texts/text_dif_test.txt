groups. We here examined this result by considering the sample
of large quasar groups published by Einasto et al. (2014),
which is drawn from the SDSS DR7 quasar catalogue in the
redshift range 1.0 ≤ z ≤ 1.8. We used the LQGs defined with
a linking length of 70 h
−1 Mpc. Because too few optical polarization
data are available for the quasars that belong to the
Einasto sample, we used radio polarization measurements from
the JVAS/CLASS 8.4-GHz surveys (Jackson et al. 2007). This
sample is claimed to be free of biases that might affect the polarization
angles. Furthermore, the polarization vectors measured at
8.4 GHz have a strong tendency to be perpendicular to the spin
axes of the SMBHs in the quasar cores. To compare the position
angles of the quasar polarization vectors with the position angles
of the systems to which the quasars belong, we studied the LQGs
through their inertia tensors in the three-dimensional comoving
space.
For rich quasar groups (m ≥ 20), we found that the spin axes
of the SMBHs are preferentially parallel to the major axes of
their host LQGs. This result adds weight to the previous finding
by Hutsemékers et al. (2014) that in two large quasar groups the
quasar spin axes (inferred from optical polarizations) align with
the group axes. Combined with the initial discovery, our analysis
indicates that the alignments of the SMBH spins axes with the
LQG major axes do not depend on the quasar radio loudness.
Additionally, the use of a large sample of LQGs allowed us
to probe the alignments for a wide variety of quasar systems. We
unveiled a surprising correlation: the relative orientations of the
spin axes of quasars with respect to the major axes of their host
LQGs appear to depend on the richness of the latter, or equivalently
on the density of objects. The spin axes of SMBHs appear
preferentially parallel to the major axes of their host LQGs when
the latter are very rich (or have a very low density), while the spin
axes become preferentially perpendicular to the LQG major axes
when the richness decreases to m ≥ 10 or, equivalently, when the
quasar density increases to 1.5 10−5
(h
−1 Mpc)−3
. No correlation
is observed below this richness or above this density. Possible interpretations
were discussed in Sect. 5, but this intriguing feature
needs to be confirmed.
In agreement with the view that the richest large quasar
groups at high redshift most likely represent the progenitors of
complexes or chains of superclusters (Einasto et al. 2014), the
correlation that we found might be the high-redshift counterpart
of the alignments at z ∼ 0 of clusters of galaxies with the superclusters
in which they are embedded (e.g. Einasto et al. 1980;
West 1999).
